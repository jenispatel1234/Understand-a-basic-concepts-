All basic concept information 

1) What is an Operating System (OS).
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides a platform for running applications. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, ensuring efficient execution of programs.

### **Functions of an Operating System:**
1. **Process Management:-** Manages running applications, multitasking, and process scheduling.
2. **Memory Management:-** Allocates and deallocates memory for applications.
3. **File System Management:-** Organizes and controls data storage on disks.
4. **Device Management:-** Handles communication between the computer and peripheral devices (printers, USBs, etc.).
5. **User Interface:-** Provides a graphical (GUI) or command-line (CLI) interface for users to interact with the computer.
6. **Security & Access Control:-** Protects data, manages user permissions, and prevents unauthorized access.

### **Examples of Operating Systems:**
- **Desktop & Laptop OS:-** Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Mobile OS:-** Android, iOS
- **Server OS:-** Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux

2) Differences between Windows and Linux.
-### **Differences Between Windows and Linux**  

1. **Source Code**  
   - **Windows:** Closed-source (proprietary).  
   - **Linux:** Open-source (free to modify).  

2. **Cost**  
   - **Windows:** Paid (Windows license required).  
   - **Linux:** Mostly free (some enterprise versions are paid).  

3. **Customization**  
   - **Windows:** Limited customization.  
   - **Linux:** Highly customizable.  

4. **User Interface (UI)**  
   - **Windows:** GUI-focused, user-friendly.  
   - **Linux:** Offers both GUI and CLI options.  

5. **Performance**  
   - **Windows:** Requires more system resources.  
   - **Linux:** Generally lightweight and efficient.  

6. **Security**  
   - **Windows:** More vulnerable to viruses & malware.  
   - **Linux:** More secure, fewer viruses.  

7. **Software Compatibility**  
   - **Windows:** Supports most commercial software (MS Office, Adobe, etc.).  
   - **Linux:** Limited support for some Windows apps (can use Wine or VM).  

8. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  
   - **Windows:** CMD and PowerShell, not commonly used by average users.  
   - **Linux:** Terminal is powerful and widely used.  

9. **File System**  
   - **Windows:** Uses NTFS, FAT32.  
   - **Linux:** Uses Ext4, XFS, Btrfs.  

10. **Gaming Support**  
    - **Windows:** Strong support, many games optimized for Windows.  
    - **Linux:** Limited support, but improving (Proton, Steam Play).  

11. **Updates**  
    - **Windows:** Automatic updates, sometimes intrusive.  
    - **Linux:** More control over updates.  

12. **User Base**  
    - **Windows:** Common among general users and businesses.  
    - **Linux:** Popular among developers, IT professionals, and servers.  

3) What is a Virtual Machine (VM).

- A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software-based simulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications just like a real machine. It allows multiple OS instances to run on a single physical computer.  

### **Key Components of a Virtual Machine:-**  
1. **Host Machine:** The physical computer that provides resources (CPU, memory, storage).  
2. **Guest OS:** The operating system running inside the VM (e.g., Windows, Linux).  
3. **Hypervisor:** The software that creates and manages VMs by allocating system resources.  

### **Types of Hypervisors:-**  
- **Type 1 (Bare-metal):** Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V).  
- **Type 2 (Hosted):** Runs on top of an OS (e.g., Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).  

### **Benefits of Virtual Machines:-**  
- **Isolation:** Each VM runs independently, preventing system conflicts.  
- **Flexibility:** Run multiple OSes on a single machine.  
- **Efficiency:** Optimize hardware usage by consolidating workloads.  
- **Security:** Test software safely without affecting the host system.  

### **Common Uses of Virtual Machines:-**  
- Running different operating systems on one computer.  
- Software testing and development.  
- Server consolidation in data centers.  
- Creating secure environments for cybersecurity testing.
